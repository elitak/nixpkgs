    # modIndexJSON is the json file fetched from mods.factorio.com and put into the local nix store
    # modIndex is that file parsed into attrs

    # XXX sometimes mod authors are sloppy and reupload a zip without changing

    updater = hashCacheUpdater { inherit hashCache username token; releases = latestReleases; }; # the runnable bit that updates the hashCache (caches uname:token in this script)

    # Now, use `let mods = pkgs.callPackage <factorio-mods> {...} in factorio-headless {mods=[mods.foobarmod-123];}` etc in your nix config
    # after setting up <factorio-mods> in the NIX_PATH to be the path to latestReleases

    # NB. final cached binary packages have hashes based on contents, so the intermediate .drv differences do not matter.
    #     This also applies to packages fetched by fetchurl: the drvs are diff if the creds are in the fetch, but final hash of the file is the same
    # XXX This takes inordinately long the first run, since it is generating and writing all the .drvs. Any way to speed it up? does MetaModsDrv have this issue?

    # WARNING username and token are cached in /nix/store/*.zip.drv files; so ensure they do not get put in the binary cache!!
