nix-channel is probably the idiom for updating nixexprs.tar.xz from factorio-mods channel, i'll update that with a script server-side, and mirror the files themselves passwordless. torrents will be used by the derivations to minimize bandwidth used.

nixos: factorio: download mod manifest, install it into store as converted into nix, then at build time in nixos module, fetch using login info
nixos: factorio: how to avoid password use? mirror the mods + client download sites myself? use torrents? integrate torrents into nix-fetch?
nixos: factorio: TODO test in nixpkgs on regular linux, then post a tutorial on how to quickly use to forums. should be more expedient than any other method for even inexperienced linux users.


see https://github.com/narc0tiq/factorio-updater/blob/master/update_factorio.py for api usage



purge all refs to "(upstream)manifest" -> "modIndex"

before committing, recheck and explain the problem:

all the complexity in the process is because:
  [runtime info: date] first drv uses incrementing date to fetch json modIndex
  [state maintained outside of store/drvs] then hashCacheUpdater has to run prefetch to compute the sha256s
  ... that are then used to compose mods.nix
  ... that are built into nixexprs.tar.xz, distributed, reimported
  ... and finally used in nixos module or .nixpkgs/config.nix


problems are:
  modIndex state and drv can change hundreds of time a day, so `date` version needs to be supplied at runtime by cronjob.
    How to address this in the context of nixos modules? I'd rather do away with cronjob nix-build hacks
  sha256 state cant be pulled in a single modIndex fetch, need to dl and compute each
    Contact devs about computing the hashes for the files for me, once I can give them the algo as code or reference to code, or tell them to run:
      nix-hash /nix/store/c5pffwrlmh8a1pi9l6ba2k3767b852kb-alien-science-0.1.2.zip --type sha256 --base32 --flat
      (sha256 is not default, nor is the base32 alphabet, nor is flat-mode i.e. do not unzip and canonicalize dates/perms and hash contents [ maybe i would want this? how to get nix-build to hash them this way?])


so goals are:
  do away with hashCache
  do away with cronning nix-build and all the env hassles, or at least get it down to 1 invocation of nix-build && ./result
    ( solution may be to just not use fromJSON . readFile? )

somewhere in the api there has to be a checksum of each release. i can maintain a table of these to avoid having to redownload and hash the releases I already have in hashes.nix and the store

release.dependencies

ask where the api docs are
ask if there is checksum or request feature on forums. same devs maintain the mod db?

investigate if any talk of "fetchtorrent" exists. use that to serve binary package caceh of all mods


try using ./nixos/lib/make-channel.nix

final problem with factorio-mods-channel.nix is that 1.12 never wants to add sigs to binary store under any circumstance, and even manually added 'Sig{s,nature{,s}' fields do not work?!

move parts of utils.nix into build-support? like the mkModDrv stuff?
